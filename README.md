Django's polls tutorial, with django 3.0.7 and python 3.8.3
See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/

My files only differ slightly from the official Django site's templates, for backwards compatibility
1) I have added not replaced imports (so that some imports are unnecessary for code to run)
2) I have commented out some previous function/method definitions, especially in ../polls/views.py
